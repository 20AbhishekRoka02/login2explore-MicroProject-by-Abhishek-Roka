# Student Enrollment Form
- This project is for my **Login2Explore** Assignment Round 2.
- Here, I have created a Student Enrollment Form, using HTML, JS, JQuery, BootStrap 3.4.1 and JSON Power DB.

## Benefits of using JSON Power DB
- No need to create Schema and no SQL commands needed, only need to include a script, and have Connection Token.
- Interact with Database using Frontend JavaScript only
- Dynamic Schema, i.e. fields adds up as per user requirements.
- Uses JSON only.
- Easy Query, using pre-defined functions.
- Simple and Fast.
- Automatically detects data type for a field in DB.
- Creates DB on run time.
- Stores Data in pre-defined DB and Relation, if DB name and Relation name is not provided.
